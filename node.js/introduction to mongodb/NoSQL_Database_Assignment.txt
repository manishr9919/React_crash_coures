1. What is a NoSQL Database, and explain the types of NoSQL databases?
ANS: NoSQL database stand not stracture language its is very flexible according to SQL language,
you can see its clear mening the data is not structured formate 


2. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
ANS: SQL databases stand for  structured query language, and have a predefined schema.
 They are best for complex queries and transactions. NoSQL databases are not structured, 
 have dynamic schemas for unstructured data, 
 and are designed for distributed data stores with large volumes of data.

3. How to choose between MongoDB and MySQL based on your requirements?
ANS: Choose MongoDB if you need a flexible schema design,
 horizontal scalability, and high performance for large volumes of unstructured data.
 Choose MySQL if you need ACID compliance, complex queries, and transactions in a structured schema.

4. What are collections and documents in a MongoDB database?
ANS: In MongoDB, a collection is a group of documents, similar to a table in relational databases.
A document is a record in a collection, represented as a JSON-like object (BSON) with key-value pairs.

5. What is BSON? What is the difference between BSON and JSON?
ANS: BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. 
BSON extends JSON with additional data types and is designed to be efficient in space and speed. 
JSON is text-based and limited to a subset of data types.

6. What are MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Shell used for?
ANS: MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface for MongoDB,
allowing users to interact with their data visually.
MongoDB Shell (mongosh) is a command-line tool used for interacting with MongoDB databases.


7. How to create collections in MongoDB?
ANS: Collections in MongoDB are created automatically when you insert a document into a collection that doesn't exist yet.
You can also create a collection manually using the `createCollection` method.
db.createCollection("name of collection")
collection should not be "-" is should be camalcase 




8. What is the difference between insertMany and insertOne?
ANS: `insertOne` inserts a single document into a collection, while `insertMany` inserts multiple documents in one operation.

9. What is the difference between deleteOne and deleteMany?
ANS: `deleteOne` deletes the first document that matches the filter criteria, while `deleteMany` deletes all documents that match the filter criteria.

10. How to read data in MongoDB? What is the difference between find and findOne?
ANS: To read data in MongoDB, you use the `find` and `findOne` methods.
`find` returns all documents that match the query criteria, while `findOne`
 returns only the first document that matches the query criteria.

11. What is $set in MongoDB?
ANS: `$set` is an update operator in MongoDB used to update the value of a field in a document. 
If the field does not exist, `$set` adds it.

12. How to filter data using MongoDB?
ANS: Data in MongoDB is filtered using query operators in the `find` method.
For example, you can use `{ field: value }` to match documents where the field has the specified value,
or use comparison operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in`, etc., to filter data based on more complex criteria.
